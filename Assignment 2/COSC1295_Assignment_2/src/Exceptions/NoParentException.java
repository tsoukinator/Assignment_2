// NoParentException when a child or young child has no parent or has only one parent, e.g.
// adding a child to one adult, or to two adults who are not a couple. That also happens when trying
// to delete an adult who has at least one dependent. (In this world a couple that have at least one kid
// become inseparable and immortal.)
